# IT_infrastructure
This repo contains all the work related to the course ica0002, IT Infrastructure Services at TalTech.
The goal of the course was to build our own fully functional, automated, and redundant IT infrastructure using Ansible and Jinja templating.
In the roles folder can be found all of the different services that were used in my IT infrastructure.
